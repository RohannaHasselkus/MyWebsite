<p class="artist-bio">My name is Rohanna Ingrid Hasselkus and I am currently a Junior at Denver School of the Arts. I am interested Visual arts due to the way it can be applied to effectively communicate a broad range of concepts through a universal language. By employing the affinity that humanity has to understand and interpret visual information, visual arts is an important tool to make complicated ideas and processes more widely accessible.
This is important due to the contemporary methods in which information, regardless of accuracy is rapidly spread. Art can be used as a weapon to educate, combatting misinformation. Beyond the field of visual arts, I am very interested in science and therefore enjoy incorporating scientific phenomena into what I create. My AP portfolio for this year concentrates on wide spread scientific myths and the facts that debunk them. Some pieces are based on social ideas surrounding who should have access to a scientific education, while others focus on misunderstandings of science itself. Below you will find my resume. To mantain relevancy to this website I ommited accomplishments/experiences that were not related to visual arts from my resume.
